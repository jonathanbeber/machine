# machine [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/caarlos0/machine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caarlos0/machine)

Machine setup, powered by Ansible.

I'm splitting my [dotfiles](https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles) repository
in two repos:

- dotfiles now handles only configuration
- machine (this) installs stuff (including my dotfiles)

For now, almost everything is a task, later I might migrate some of them
to roles, so they can evolve separately and be used by other people as well.

## Usage:

```console
$ wget https://github.com/caarlos0/machine/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ cd machine-master
```

At this point, you might want to edit the `main.yml` file and comment
out stuff you don't want, when you're done, simply run:

```console
$ ./setup
```

## Known Bugs

- Due to an [ansible bug](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/issues/3752),
this may not work on Ubuntu machines with ansible 2.1.0.0. You can install
ansible 2.2.0.0 using `pip` with `pip install git+git://github.com/ansible/ansible.git@devel`
to avoid this problem.
